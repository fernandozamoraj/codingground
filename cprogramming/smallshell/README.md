# This is an example of a shell created for nix systems
# you cannot run it on windows. It must be run on a linux/unix system.
# it provides examples of how to do some of the following things
- Make sytems calls (chdir, dup2, SIGINT, )
- Use the family of exec system calls
- It is not cleanest code by far but it mostly works
- credit for this one goes to an anonymos user
