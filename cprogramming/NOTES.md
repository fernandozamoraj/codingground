# 1. catch unit testing does not produce output
Unfortunately, sometimes when catch errors out it does not provide any output.
That is why you should build up your tests as you go instead of adding them all at once.
If you do run into this problem it may be a good a idea to add your tests in chunks at a time until it breaks so that you can identify the problem
