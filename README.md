Main Repository for Coding Ground

## What is coding ground
Coding ground repo is a central location where I store many of the coding gems
that I have personally worked or have acquired from resources on the internet.
Whereever I have acquired the code from elesewhere I will do my best to give credit.
If you see something where credit belongs to you please contact me.

Coding ground also has valuable resources for future reference.
